An AS is a set of routers under a single technical administration, using an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway protocol to route packets to other ASs'. IANA maintains the AS number space and has delegated large parts to the regional registries. Autonomous system numbers were originally limited to 16 bits. BGP extensions have enlarged the autonomous system number space to 32 bits. This type therefore uses an uint32 base type without a range restriction in order to support a larger autonomous system number space.

"description": ["The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name. The name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible. Internet domain names are only loosely specified. Section 3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section 2.1 of RFC 1123). The pattern above is intended to allow for current practice in domain name use, and some possible future expansion. It is designed to hold various types of domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records (host names) and other records, such as SRV records. Note that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and 1123, and that systems that want to store host names in schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability. The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited to 255 characters. Since the encoding consists of labels prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted notation. The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to IP addresses. Note that the resolution of a domain-name value may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4 and AAAA for IPv6). The order of the resolution process and which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the resolver. Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding. Their canonical format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters. Internationalized domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC 3492"]

Objects using the uri type MUST be in US-ASCII encoding, and MUST be normalized as described by RFC 3986 Sections 6.2.1, 6.2.2.1, and 6.2.2.2. All unnecessary percent-encoding is removed, and all case-insensitive characters are set to lowercase except for hexadecimal digits, which are normalized to uppercase as described in Section 6.2.2.1. The purpose of this normalization is to help provide unique URIs. Note that this normalization is not sufficient to provide uniqueness. Two URIs that are textually distinct after this normalization may still be equivalent. Objects using the uri type may restrict the schemes that they permit. For example, 'data:' and 'urn:' schemes might not be appropriate. A zero-length URI is not a valid URI. This can be used to express 'URI absent' where required. In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent to the Uri SMIv2 textual convention defined in RFC 5017."]
